# Fortnite Resolution Changer :wrench: :video_game:
## What is this?

This is a simple C++ program that I made in my free time. It changes the resolution in the `GameUserSettings.ini` of Fortnite.

## How to use?

Just download and open the [executable](https://github.com/ExoticGamerrrYT/fortnite-resolution-changer/tree/master/build), then input ur X and Y resolution. Have a great time!
